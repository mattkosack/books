# books

This is a repository where I will put any code that I write as practice or as examples from various books I read. 

There may be some other random examples or small projects slapped into here as well. I will try to keep any *real* items out of this repo.

I will primarily be reading through some of the books found at https://www.programmingbooks.dev/. They seem to be good books. I will also throw in some other sections as well, such as Computer Vision books.
